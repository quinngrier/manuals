<p>Info is a program for reading documentation, which you are using now.
</p>
<p>To learn how to use Info, type the command <kbd>h</kbd>.  It brings you
to a programmed instruction sequence.
</p>

<p>To learn advanced Info commands, type <kbd>n</kbd> twice.  This
brings you to <cite>Info for Experts</cite>, skipping over the .

<p>Since your terminal has an unusually small number of lines on its
screen, it is necessary to give you special advice at the beginning.
</p>
<p>If you see the text &lsquo;<samp>--All----</samp>&rsquo; at near the bottom right corner
of the screen, it means the entire text you are looking at fits on the
screen.  If you see &lsquo;<samp>--Top----</samp>&rsquo; instead, it means that there is
more text below that does not fit.  To move forward through the text
and see another screen full, press the Space bar, <tt class="key">SPC</tt>.  To move
back up, press the key labeled &lsquo;<samp>Rubout</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>Delete</samp>&rsquo; or
<tt class="key">DEL</tt>.
</p>
<p>Here are 40 lines of junk, so you can try <tt class="key">SPC</tt> and <tt class="key">DEL</tt> and
see what they do.  At the end are instructions of what you should do
next.

<p>If you have managed to get here, go back to the beginning with

<tt class="key">DEL</tt>.  So now type an <kbd>n</kbd>&mdash;just one character; do not type
the quotes and do not type the Return key, <tt class="key">RET</tt>, afterward&mdash;to

<span id="How-to-use-Info"></span><h3 class="section">1.2 How to use Info</h3>

<p>You are talking to the program Info, for reading documentation.
</p>
<p>Right now you are looking at one <em>Node</em> of Information.
A node contains text describing a specific topic at a specific
level of detail.  This node&rsquo;s topic is &ldquo;how to use Info&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The top line of a node is its <em>header</em>.  This node&rsquo;s header (look at
it now) says that it is the node named &lsquo;<samp>Help</samp>&rsquo; in the file
<samp>info</samp>.  It says that the &lsquo;<samp>Next</samp>&rsquo; node after this one is the node
called &lsquo;<samp>Help-P</samp>&rsquo;.  An advanced Info command lets you go to any node
whose name you know.
</p>
<p>Besides a &lsquo;<samp>Next</samp>&rsquo;, a node can have a &lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo; or an &lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo;.
This node has a &lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo; but no &lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo;, as you can see.
</p>
<p>Now it is time to move on to the &lsquo;<samp>Next</samp>&rsquo; node, named &lsquo;<samp>Help-P</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Type &lsquo;<samp>n</samp>&rsquo; to move there.  Type just one character;
   do not type the quotes and do not type a <tt class="key">RET</tt> afterward.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp>&gt;&gt;</samp>&rsquo; in the margin means it is really time to try a command.
</p>
<hr>
<span id="Help_002dP"></span><div class="header">
<p>

</div>
<span id="Returning-to-the-Previous-node"></span><h3 class="section">1.3 Returning to the Previous node</h3>

<p>This node is called &lsquo;<samp>Help-P</samp>&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo; node, as you see,
is &lsquo;<samp>Help</samp>&rsquo;, which is the one you just came from using the <kbd>n</kbd>
command.  Another <kbd>n</kbd> command now would take you to the next
node, &lsquo;<samp>Help-^L</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But do not do that yet.  First, try the <kbd>p</kbd> command, which takes
   you to the &lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo; node.  When you get there, you can do an
   <kbd>n</kbd> again to return here.
</p>
<p>This all probably seems insultingly simple so far, but <em>do not</em> be
led into skimming.  Things will get more complicated soon.  Also,
do not try a new command until you are told it is time to.  Otherwise,
you may make Info skip past an important warning that was coming up.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now do an <kbd>n</kbd> to get to the node &lsquo;<samp>Help-^L</samp>&rsquo; and learn more.
</p>
<hr>
<span id="Help_002d_005eL"></span><div class="header">
<p>
Next: <a href="#Help_002dM" accesskey="n" rel="next">Help-M</a>, Previous: <a href="#Help_002dP" accesskey="p" rel="prev">Help-P</a>, Up: <a href="#Getting-Started" accesskey="u" rel="up">Getting Started</a> &nbsp; </p>

<span id="The-Space_002c-Rubout_002c-B-and-_005eL-commands_002e"></span><h3 class="section">1.4 The Space, Rubout, B and ^L commands.</h3>

<p>This node&rsquo;s header tells you that you are now at node &lsquo;<samp>Help-^L</samp>&rsquo;, and
that <kbd>p</kbd> would get you back to &lsquo;<samp>Help-P</samp>&rsquo;.  The node&rsquo;s title is
underlined; it says what the node is about (most nodes have titles).
</p>
<p>This is a big node and it does not all fit on your display screen.
You can tell that there is more that is not visible because you
can see the string &lsquo;<samp>--Top-----</samp>&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<samp>--All----</samp>&rsquo; near
the bottom right corner of the screen.
</p>
<p>The <tt class="key">SPC</tt>, <tt class="key">DEL</tt> and <kbd>b</kbd> commands exist to allow you to &ldquo;move
around&rdquo; in a node that does not all fit on the screen at once.
<tt class="key">SPC</tt> moves forward, to show what was below the bottom of the screen.
<tt class="key">DEL</tt> moves backward, to show what was above the top of the screen
(there is not anything above the top until you have typed some spaces).
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now try typing a <tt class="key">SPC</tt> (afterward, type a <tt class="key">DEL</tt> to return here).
</p>
<p>When you type the <tt class="key">SPC</tt>, the two lines that were at the bottom
of the screen appear at the top, followed by more lines.  <tt class="key">DEL</tt>
takes the two lines from the top and moves them to the bottom,
<em>usually</em>, but if there are not a full screen&rsquo;s worth of lines above
them they may not make it all the way to the bottom.
</p>
<p>If you type a <tt class="key">SPC</tt> when there is no more to see, it rings the
bell and otherwise does nothing.  The same goes for a <tt class="key">DEL</tt> when
the header of the node is visible.
</p>
<p>If your screen is ever garbaged, you can tell Info to print it out
again by typing <kbd>C-l</kbd> (<kbd>Control-L</kbd>, that is&mdash;hold down &ldquo;Control&rdquo; and
type an <tt class="key">L</tt> or <kbd>l</kbd>).
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>C-l</kbd> now.
</p>
<p>To move back to the beginning of the node you are on, you can type
a lot of <tt class="key">DEL</tt>s.  You can also type simply <kbd>b</kbd> for beginning.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Try that now.  (I have put in enough verbiage to make sure you are
   not on the first screenful now).  Then come back, typing <tt class="key">SPC</tt>
   several times.
</p>
<p>You have just learned a considerable number of commands.  If you
want to use one but have trouble remembering which, you should type
a <tt class="key">?</tt> which prints out a brief list of commands.  When you are
finished looking at the list, make it go away by typing a <tt class="key">SPC</tt>.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Type a <tt class="key">?</tt> now.  After it finishes, type a <tt class="key">SPC</tt>.
</p>
<p>(If you are using the standalone Info reader, type &lsquo;l&rsquo; to return here.)
</p>
<p>From now on, you will encounter large nodes without warning, and
will be expected to know how to use <tt class="key">SPC</tt> and <tt class="key">DEL</tt> to move
around in them without being told.  Since not all terminals have
the same size screen, it would be impossible to warn you anyway.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>n</kbd> to see the description of the <kbd>m</kbd> command.
</p>

</div>
<span id="Menus-1"></span><h3 class="section">1.5 Menus</h3>

<p>Menus and the <kbd>m</kbd> command
</p>
<p>With only the <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd> commands for moving between nodes, nodes
are restricted to a linear sequence.  Menus allow a branching
structure.  A menu is a list of other nodes you can move to.  It is
actually just part of the text of the node formatted specially so that
Info can interpret it.  The beginning of a menu is always identified
by a line which starts with &lsquo;<samp>* Menu:</samp>&rsquo;.  A node contains a menu if and
only if it has a line in it which starts that way.  The only menu you
can use at any moment is the one in the node you are in.  To use a
menu in any other node, you must move to that node first. 
</p>
<p>After the start of the menu, each line that starts with a &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo;
identifies one subtopic.  The line usually contains a brief name
for the subtopic (followed by a &lsquo;<samp>:</samp>&rsquo;), the name of the node that talks
about that subtopic, and optionally some further description of the
subtopic.  Lines in the menu that do not start with a &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; have no
special meaning&mdash;they are only for the human reader&rsquo;s benefit and do
not define additional subtopics.  Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">* Foo:  FOO's Node      This tells about FOO
</pre></div>

<p>The subtopic name is Foo, and the node describing it is &lsquo;<samp>FOO's Node</samp>&rsquo;.
The rest of the line is just for the reader&rsquo;s Information.
[[ But this line is not a real menu item, simply because there is
no line above it which starts with &lsquo;<samp>* Menu:</samp>&rsquo;.]]
</p>
<p>When you use a menu to go to another node (in a way that will be
described soon), what you specify is the subtopic name, the first
thing in the menu line.  Info uses it to find the menu line, extracts
the node name from it, and goes to that node.  The reason that there
is both a subtopic name and a node name is that the node name must be
meaningful to the computer and may therefore have to be ugly looking.
The subtopic name can be chosen just to be convenient for the user to
specify.  Often the node name is convenient for the user to specify
and so both it and the subtopic name are the same.  There is an
abbreviation for this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">* Foo::   This tells about FOO
</pre></div>

<p>This means that the subtopic name and node name are the same; they are
both &lsquo;<samp>Foo</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now use <tt class="key">SPC</tt>s to find the menu in this node, then come back to
   the front with a <kbd>b</kbd>.  As you see, a menu is actually visible in
   its node.  If you cannot find a menu in a node by looking at it,
   then the node does not have a menu and the <kbd>m</kbd> command is not
   available.
</p>
<p>The command to go to one of the subnodes is <kbd>m</kbd>&mdash;but <em>do not do it
yet!</em>  Before you use <kbd>m</kbd>, you must understand the difference between
commands and arguments.  So far, you have learned several commands
that do not need arguments.  When you type one, Info processes it and
is instantly ready for another command.  The <kbd>m</kbd> command is different:
it is incomplete without the <em>name of the subtopic</em>.  Once you have
typed <kbd>m</kbd>, Info tries to read the subtopic name.
</p>
<p>Now look for the line containing many dashes near the bottom of the
screen.  There is one more line beneath that one, but usually it is
blank If it is empty, Info is ready for a command, such as <kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>b</kbd>
or <tt class="key">SPC</tt> or <kbd>m</kbd>.  If that line contains text ending in a colon, it
mean Info is trying to read the <em>argument</em> to a command.  At such
times, commands do not work, because Info tries to use them as the
argument.  You must either type the argument and finish the command
you started, or type <kbd>Control-g</kbd> to cancel the command.  When you have
done one of those things, the line becomes blank again.
</p>
<p>The command to go to a subnode via a menu is <kbd>m</kbd>.  After you type
the <kbd>m</kbd>, the line at the bottom of the screen says &lsquo;<samp>Menu item: </samp>&rsquo;.
You must then type the name of the subtopic you want, and end it with
a <tt class="key">RET</tt>.
</p>
<p>You can abbreviate the subtopic name.  If the abbreviation is not
unique, the first matching subtopic is chosen.  Some menus put
the shortest possible abbreviation for each subtopic name in capital
letters, so you can see how much you need to type.  It does not
matter whether you use upper case or lower case when you type the
subtopic.  You should not put any spaces at the end, or inside of the
item name, except for one space where a space appears in the item in
the menu.
</p>
<p>Here is a menu to give you a chance to practice.
</p>
<p>* Menu:	   The menu starts here.
</p>
<p>This menu givs you three ways of going to one place, Help-FOO.
</p>
<p>* Foo:  Help-FOO.       A node you can visit for fun.<br>
* Bar:  Help-FOO.       Strange!  two ways to get to the same place.<br>
* Help-FOO::            And yet another!<br>
</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;  Now type just an <kbd>m</kbd> and see what happens:
</p>
<p>Now you are &ldquo;inside&rdquo; an <kbd>m</kbd> command.  Commands cannot be used
now; the next thing you will type must be the name of a subtopic.
</p>
<p>You can change your mind about doing the <kbd>m</kbd> by typing Control-g.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Try that now;  notice the bottom line clear.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Then type another <kbd>m</kbd>.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now type &lsquo;<samp>BAR</samp>&rsquo; item name.  Do not type <tt class="key">RET</tt> yet.
</p>
<p>While you are typing the item name, you can use the <tt class="key">DEL</tt>
character to cancel one character at a time if you make a mistake.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Type one to cancel the &lsquo;<samp>R</samp>&rsquo;.  You could type another &lsquo;<samp>R</samp>&rsquo; to
   replace it.  You do not have to, since &lsquo;<samp>BA</samp>&rsquo; is a valid abbreviation.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now you are ready to go.  Type a <tt class="key">RET</tt>.
</p>
<p>After visiting Help-FOO, you should return here.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>n</kbd> to see more commands.
</p>

<p>Here is another way to get to  Help-FOO, a menu.  You can ignore this
if you want, or else try it (but then please come back to here).
</p>
<table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0">

<p>Congratulations!  This is the node &lsquo;<samp>Help-FOO</samp>&rsquo;.  Unlike the other
nodes you have seen, this one has an &lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo;: &lsquo;<samp>Help-M</samp>&rsquo;, the node you
just came from via the <kbd>m</kbd> command.  This is the usual
convention&mdash;the nodes you reach from a menu have &lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo; nodes that lead
back to the menu.  Menus move Down in the tree, and &lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo; moves Up.
&lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo;, on the other hand, is usually used to &ldquo;stay on the same
level but go backwards&rdquo;
</p>
<p>You can go back to the node &lsquo;<samp>Help-M</samp>&rsquo; by typing the command
<kbd>u</kbd> for &ldquo;Up&rdquo;.  That puts you at the <em>front</em> of the
node&mdash;to get back to where you were reading you have to type
some <tt class="key">SPC</tt>s.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>u</kbd> to move back up to &lsquo;<samp>Help-M</samp>&rsquo;.

do that, one node at a time.  If you have been following directions,
an <kbd>l</kbd> command now will get you back to &lsquo;<samp>Help-M</samp>&rsquo;.  Another
<kbd>l</kbd> command would undo the <kbd>u</kbd> and get you back to
&lsquo;<samp>Help-FOO</samp>&rsquo;.  Another <kbd>l</kbd> would undo the <kbd>m</kbd> and get you
back to &lsquo;<samp>Help-M</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Try typing three <kbd>l</kbd>&rsquo;s, pausing in between to see what each
    <kbd>l</kbd> does.
</p>
<p>Then follow directions again and you will end up back here.
</p>
<p>Note the difference between <kbd>l</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd>: <kbd>l</kbd> moves to
where <em>you</em> last were, whereas <kbd>p</kbd> always moves to the node
which the header says is the &lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo; node (from this node, to
&lsquo;<samp>Help-M</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>d</samp>&rsquo; command gets you instantly to the Directory node.
This node, which is the first one you saw when you entered Info,
has a menu which leads (directly, or indirectly through other menus),
to all the nodes that exist.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Try doing a &lsquo;<samp>d</samp>&rsquo;, then do an <kbd>l</kbd> to return here (yes,
   <em>do</em> return).
</p>
<p>Sometimes, in Info documentation, you will see a cross reference.
Cross references look like this: See <a href="#Help_002dCross">Cross</a>.  That is a
real, live cross reference which is named &lsquo;<samp>Cross</samp>&rsquo; and points at
the node named &lsquo;<samp>Help-Cross</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>If you wish to follow a cross reference, you must use the &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;
command.  The &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; must be followed by the cross reference name
(in this case, &lsquo;<samp>Cross</samp>&rsquo;).  You can use <tt class="key">DEL</tt> to edit the name,
and if you change your mind about following any reference you can use
<kbd>Control-g</kbd> to cancel the command.
</p>
<p>Completion is available in the &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; command; you can complete among
all the cross reference names in the current node.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Type &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;, followed by &lsquo;<samp>Cross</samp>&rsquo;, and a <tt class="key">RET</tt>.
</p>
<p>To get a list of all the cross references in the current node, you can
type <kbd>?</kbd> after an &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; continues to await a
cross reference name even after printing the list, so if you do not
actually want to follow a reference you should type a <kbd>Control-g</kbd>
to cancel the &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Type &quot;f?&quot; to get a list of the footnotes in this node.  Then type a
   <kbd>Control-g</kbd> and see how the &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; gives up.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>n</kbd> to see the last node of the course.

<p><kbd>g</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd>, <kbd>1</kbd>, &ndash; <kbd>5</kbd>, and <kbd>e</kbd>
</p>
<p>If you know a node&rsquo;s name, you can go there by typing <kbd>g</kbd>, the
name, and <tt class="key">RET</tt>.  Thus, <kbd>gTop<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> would go to the node
called &lsquo;<samp>Top</samp>&rsquo; in this file (its directory node).
<kbd>gExpert<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> would come back here.
</p>
<p>Unlike <kbd>m</kbd>, <kbd>g</kbd> does not allow the use of abbreviations.
</p>
<p>To go to a node in another file, you can include the filename in the
node name by putting it at the front, in parentheses.  Thus,
<kbd>g(dir)Top<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> would go to the Info Directory node, which is
node &lsquo;<samp>Top</samp>&rsquo; in the file <samp>dir</samp>.
</p>
<p>The node name &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; specifies the whole file.  So you can look at
all of the current file by typing <kbd>g*<span class="key">RET</span></kbd> or all of any
other file with <kbd>g(FILENAME)<span class="key">RET</span></kbd>.
</p>
<p>The <kbd>s</kbd> command allows you to search a whole file for a string.
It switches to the next node if and when that is necessary.  You
type <kbd>s</kbd> followed by the string to search for, terminated by
<tt class="key">RET</tt>.  To search for the same string again, just <kbd>s</kbd> followed
by <tt class="key">RET</tt> will do.  The file&rsquo;s nodes are scanned in the order
they are in in the file, which has no necessary relationship to the
order that they may be in in the tree structure of menus and &lsquo;<samp>next</samp>&rsquo; pointers.
But normally the two orders are not very different.  In any case,
you can always do a <kbd>b</kbd> to find out what node you have reached, if
the header is not visible (this can happen, because <kbd>s</kbd> puts your
cursor at the occurrence of the string, not at the beginning of the
node).
</p>
<p>If you grudge the system each character of type-in it requires, you
might like to use the commands <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd>, <kbd>4</kbd>, and
<kbd>5</kbd>.  They are short for the <kbd>m</kbd> command together with an
argument.  &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, and &quot;5&quot;.  <kbd>1</kbd> goes through the
first item in the current node&rsquo;s menu; <kbd>2</kbd> goes through the second
item, etc.  Note that numbers larger than 5 are not allowed.  If the
item you want is that far down, you are better off using an
abbreviation for its name than counting.
</p>
<p>The Info command <kbd>e</kbd> changes from Info mode to an ordinary
Emacs editing mode, so that you can edit the text of the current node.
Type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to switch back to Info.  The <kbd>e</kbd> command is allowed
only if the variable <code>Info-enable-edit</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.

<span id="Adding-a-new-node-to-Info"></span><h3 class="section">2.2 Adding a new node to Info</h3>

<p>To add a new topic to the list in the directory, you must:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Create a node, in some file, to document that topic.

</li><li> Put that topic in the menu in the directory.  See <a href="#Menus">Menu</a>.
</li></ol>

<p>The new node can live in an existing documentation file, or in a new
one.  It must have a <tt class="key">^_</tt> character before it (invisible to the
user; this node has one but you cannot see it), and it ends with either
a <tt class="key">^_</tt>, a <tt class="key">^L</tt>, or the end of file.  Note: If you put in a
<tt class="key">^L</tt> to end a new node, be sure that there is a <tt class="key">^_</tt> after it
to start the next one, since <tt class="key">^L</tt> cannot <em>start</em> a node.
Also, a nicer way to make a node boundary be a page boundary as well
is to put a <tt class="key">^L</tt> <em>right after</em> the <tt class="key">^_</tt>.
</p>
<p>The <tt class="key">^_</tt> starting a node must be followed by a newline or a
<tt class="key">^L</tt> newline, after which comes the node&rsquo;s header line.  The
header line must give the node&rsquo;s name (by which Info finds it),
and state the names of the &lsquo;<samp>Next</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo; nodes (if
there are any).  As you can see, this node&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo; node is the node
&lsquo;<samp>Top</samp>&rsquo;, which points at all the documentation for Info.  The &lsquo;<samp>Next</samp>&rsquo;
node is &lsquo;<samp>Menus</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The keywords <em>Node</em>, <em>Previous</em>, <em>Up</em> and <em>Next</em>,
may appear in any order, anywhere in the header line, but the
recommended order is the one in this sentence.  Each keyword must be
followed by a colon, spaces and tabs, and then the appropriate name.
The name may be terminated with a tab, a comma, or a newline.  A space
does not end it; node names may contain spaces.  The case of letters
in the names is insignificant.
</p>
<p>A node name has two forms.  A node in the current file is named by
what appears after the &lsquo;<samp>Node: </samp>&rsquo; in that node&rsquo;s first line.  For
example, this node&rsquo;s name is &lsquo;<samp>Add</samp>&rsquo;.  A node in another file is
named by &lsquo;<samp>(<var>filename</var>)<var>node-within-file</var></samp>&rsquo;, as in
&lsquo;<samp>(info)Add</samp>&rsquo; for this node.  If the file name is relative, it is
taken starting from the standard Info file directory of your site.
The name &lsquo;<samp>(<var>filename</var>)Top</samp>&rsquo; can be abbreviated to just
&lsquo;<samp>(<var>filename</var>)</samp>&rsquo;.  By convention, the name &lsquo;<samp>Top</samp>&rsquo; is used for
the &ldquo;highest&rdquo; node in any single file&mdash;the node whose &lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo; points
out of the file.  The Directory node is <samp>(dir)</samp>.  The &lsquo;<samp>Top</samp>&rsquo; node
of a document file listed in the Directory should have an &lsquo;<samp>Up:
(dir)</samp>&rsquo; in it.
</p>
<p>The node name <kbd>*</kbd> is special: it refers to the entire file.
Thus, <kbd>g*</kbd> shows you the whole current file.  The use of the
node <kbd>*</kbd> is to make it possible to make old-fashioned,
unstructured files into nodes of the tree.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>Node:</samp>&rsquo; name, in which a node states its own name, must not
contain a filename, since Info when searching for a node does not
expect one to be there.  The &lsquo;<samp>Next</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo; names may
contain them.  In this node, since the &lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo; node is in the same file,
it was not necessary to use one.
</p>
<p>Note that the nodes in this file have a file name in the header
line.  The file names are ignored by Info, but they serve as comments
to help identify the node for the user.

<span id="How-to-Create-Menus"></span><h3 class="section">2.3 How to Create Menus</h3>

<p>Any node in the Info hierarchy may have a <em>menu</em>&mdash;a list of subnodes. 
The <kbd>m</kbd> command searches the current node&rsquo;s menu for the topic which it
reads from the terminal.
</p>
<p>A menu begins with a line starting with &lsquo;<samp>* Menu:</samp>&rsquo;.  The rest of the
line is a comment.  After the starting line, every line that begins
with a &lsquo;<samp>* </samp>&rsquo; lists a single topic.  The name of the topic&ndash;the
argument that the user must give to the <kbd>m</kbd> command to select this
topic&mdash;comes right after the star and space, and is followed by a
colon, spaces and tabs, and the name of the node which discusses that
topic.  The node name, like node names following &lsquo;<samp>Next</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo;, may be terminated with a tab, comma, or newline; it may also
be terminated with a period.
</p>
<p>If the node name and topic name are the same, than rather than
giving the name twice, the abbreviation &lsquo;<samp>* NAME::</samp>&rsquo; may be used
(and should be used, whenever possible, as it reduces the visual
clutter in the menu).
</p>
<p>It is considerate to choose the topic names so that they differ
from each other very near the beginning&mdash;this allows the user to type
short abbreviations.  In a long menu, it is a good idea to capitalize
the beginning of each item name which is the minimum acceptable
abbreviation for it (a long menu is more than 5 or so entries).
</p>
<p>The nodes listed in a node&rsquo;s menu are called its &ldquo;subnodes&rdquo;, and
it is their &ldquo;superior&rdquo;.  They should each have an &lsquo;<samp>Up:</samp>&rsquo; pointing at
the superior.  It is often useful to arrange all or most of the
subnodes in a sequence of &lsquo;<samp>Next</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo; pointers so that someone who
wants to see them all need not keep revisiting the Menu.
</p>
<p>The Info Directory is simply the menu of the node &lsquo;<samp>(dir)Top</samp>&rsquo;&mdash;that
is, node &lsquo;<samp>Top</samp>&rsquo; in file <samp>.../info/dir</samp>.  You can put new entries
in that menu just like any other menu.  The Info Directory is <em>not</em> the
same as the file directory called <samp>info</samp>.  It happens that many of
Info&rsquo;s files live on that file directory, but they do not have to; and
files on that directory are not automatically listed in the Info
Directory node.
</p>
<p>Also, although the Info node graph is claimed to be a &ldquo;hierarchy&rdquo;,
in fact it can be <em>any</em> directed graph.  Shared structures and
pointer cycles are perfectly possible, and can be used if they are
appropriate to the meaning to be expressed.  There is no need for all
the nodes in a file to form a connected structure.  In fact, this file
has two connected components.  You are in one of them, which is under
the node &lsquo;<samp>Top</samp>&rsquo;; the other contains the node &lsquo;<samp>Help</samp>&rsquo; which the
<kbd>h</kbd> command goes to.  In fact, since there is no garbage
collector, nothing terrible happens if a substructure is not pointed
to, but such a substructure is rather useless since nobody can
ever find out that it exists.

<span id="Creating-Cross-References"></span><h3 class="section">2.4 Creating Cross References</h3>

<p>A cross reference can be placed anywhere in the text, unlike a menu
item which must go at the front of a line.  A cross reference looks
like a menu item except that it has &lsquo;<samp>*note</samp>&rsquo; instead of <kbd>*</kbd>.
It <em>cannot</em> be terminated by a &lsquo;<samp>)</samp>&rsquo;, because &lsquo;<samp>)</samp>&rsquo;&rsquo;s are
so often part of node names.  If you wish to enclose a cross reference
in parentheses, terminate it with a period first.  Here are two
examples of cross references pointers:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">*Note details: commands.  (See *note 3: Full Proof.)

<span id="Tag-Tables-for-Info-Files"></span><h3 class="section">2.5 Tag Tables for Info Files</h3>

<p>You can speed up the access to nodes of a large Info file by giving
it a tag table.  Unlike the tag table for a program, the tag table for
an Info file lives inside the file itself and is used 
automatically whenever Info reads in the file.
</p>
<p>To make a tag table, go to a node in the file using Emacs Info mode and type
<kbd>M-x Info-tagify</kbd>.  Then you must use <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> to save the
file.
</p>
<p>Once the Info file has a tag table, you must make certain it is up
to date.  If, as a result of deletion of text, any node moves back
more than a thousand characters in the file from the position
recorded in the tag table, Info will no longer be able to find that
node.  To update the tag table, use the <code>Info-tagify</code> command again.
</p>
<p>An Info file tag table appears at the end of the file and looks like
this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">^_&#12;
Tag Table:
File: info, Node: Cross-refs^?21419
File: info,  Node: Tags^?22145
^_
End Tag Table
</pre></div>

<p>Note that it contains one line per node, and this line contains
the beginning of the node&rsquo;s header (ending just after the node name),
a <tt class="key">DEL</tt> character, and the character position in the file of the
beginning of the node.

<span id="Checking-an-Info-File"></span><h3 class="section">2.6 Checking an Info File</h3>

<p>When creating an Info file, it is easy to forget the name of a node
when you are making a pointer to it from another node.  If you put in
the wrong name for a node, this is not detected until someone
tries to go through the pointer using Info.  Verification of the Info
file is an automatic process which checks all pointers to nodes and
reports any pointers which are invalid.  Every &lsquo;<samp>Next</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp>Up</samp>&rsquo; is checked, as is every menu item and every cross reference.  In
addition, any &lsquo;<samp>Next</samp>&rsquo; which does not have a &lsquo;<samp>Previous</samp>&rsquo; pointing back is
reported.  Only pointers within the file are checked, because checking
pointers to other files would be terribly slow.  But those are usually
few.
</p>
<p>To check an Info file, do <kbd>M-x Info-validate</kbd> while looking at
any node of the file with Emacs Info mode.
