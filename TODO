The following build scripts still need to be updated to be self
sufficient in their directories modulo symbolic link flattening:

      autoconf/*/build
      automake/*/build
      bash/*/build
      bootstrap/*/build
      common/mathjax/3.1.2/build (??)
      cppreference/*/build
      gm4/*/build
      texinfo/*/build

Add groff manuals.

Remove ansi2knr everywhere. This is just part of the build system when
the "ansi2knr" option is used with Automake.
